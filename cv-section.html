    <p>
      Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics; joined Accenture in Warsaw as my first professional position to take part in building and maintaining internet banking front-end (earlier core-banking). I'm a part of an international team in Agile environment. My focus in learning outside work are Ruby on Rails, Python and JavaScript (+ES6), I also have basic knowledge of C++ and Java. I enjoy building front-end very much, as it is quick to test and modify. Using Linux and Git every day. Aspiring for a full-stack.
